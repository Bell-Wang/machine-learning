The goal is to predict the miles per gallon a car will get using six quantities about that car.
The data set contains 392 instances of different car models, each containing a 6-dimensional feature vector (plus a dimension of 1â€™s for the intercept) contained in X, and its average miles per gallon which we treat as the output contained in y.
