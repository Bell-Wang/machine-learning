DATA README
The following data is included:
Xtrain : 20 x 5000 matrix of training data for digits 0 through 9.
label_train : 5000 dimensional vector containing the corresponding
class (digit) in Xtrain.
Xtest : 20 x 500 matrix of testing data for digits 0 through 9.
label_test : 500 dimensional vector containing the corresponding
class (digit) in Xtest.
Q : 784 x 20 matrix of principal components. You will only need this
matrix for visualizing the images asked for. The original data contains
28 x 28 images that are vectorized into 784 x 1 vectors. I projected the
data onto its first 20 principle components to reduce the dimensionality
of the problem. These components are contained in Q. You can see the
information captured by these 20 vectors as follows: For a 20 x 1 vector
"x" from a training or testing matrix, let y = Q*x. Then show this as an
image, e.g., in Matlab using imagesc(reshape(y,28,28)). The image will
probably need to be rotated and/or flipped. Some information is lost in
this process (and the data was centered) so the resulting images wonâ€™t
be crystal clear, but the digit should be recognizable.
***IMPORTANT (FOR PART 3c ONLY)***
Before training and testing the classifier, be sure to add a 21st
dimension to the data set equal to one in order to allow for a shift
in the decision boundary! Therefore, the classification vectors
w_0, ..., w_9 should be 21 dimensions. And the 21st row of X show
be entirely equal to one.
